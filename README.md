# Mark Ups and Downs

This repository contains all the files used to create a presentation on using Markdown for writing academic papers, and on some steps that it is possible to take to go from "raw" Markdown texts to final, camera-ready paper ready for submission to a journal or conference. The presentation was given by [Frank Loesche](https://www.cognovo.eu/people/research-fellows/frank-loesche.php) and [Ilaria Torre](http://cognovo.eu/people/research-fellows/ilaria-torre.php), on 08/02/2017, at a *Coding Lunch* session in the [School of Psychology](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) of Plymouth University. 

* The doc folder contains the presentation slides.
* The examples folder contains the examples mentioned in the presentation as well as others.

You can download everything [in a zip file](https://github.com/floesche/R-workshops/archive/master.zip), or clone this repository.
