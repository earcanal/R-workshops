# Tutorials

This repository contains all the files used to create a presentations on Markdown / Rmarkdown as well as an introduction to data manipulation with tidyverse.

You can download everything [in a zip file](https://github.com/floesche/R-workshops/archive/master.zip), or clone this repository.

## Mark Ups and Downs

This repository contains all the files used to create a presentation on using Markdown for writing academic papers, and on some steps that it is possible to take to go from "raw" Markdown texts to final, camera-ready paper ready for submission to a journal or conference. By  utilising the *literate programming* approach and applying it to the field of Cognitive Science and particularly Psychology, this workshop provides a solution on how to generate reproducible research and academic writing.

The presentation was given by [Frank Loesche](https://www.cognovo.eu/frank-loesche) and [Ilaria Torre](https://cognovo.eu/ilaria-torre), on 08/02/2017, at a *Coding Lunch* session in the [School of Psychology](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/schools/psychology/) of Plymouth University. They are both part of the [CogNovo Research Group](https://CogNovo.eu) there.

## Data Workflow â€“ The restaurant at the end of the tidyverse 

In this presentation [Frank Loesche](https://www.cognovo.eu/frank-loesche) highlights some best practices regarding the workflow in an exploratory data analysis. These best practices are implemented and heavily rely on [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org) packages.

## Make

If you are on a system that supports Makefiles, you can type `make` in a terminal to generate all the files, for example the presentation and the examples. Make allows to quickly regenerate target files from a changed source by keeping track of what needs to be done. In RStudio you can rebuild everything by using the keyboard shortcut [Ctrl]-[Shift]-[B] or select `Build`->`Build All` in the menu. Thanks to @earcanal for the initial Makefile.
