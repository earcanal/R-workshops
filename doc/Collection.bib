  abstract     = {A grammar of graphics is a tool that enables us to concisely describe the components
of a graphic. Such a grammar allows us to move beyond named graphics (e.g., the “scat-
terplot”) and gain insight into the deep structure that underlies statistical graphics. This
article builds on Wilkinson, Anand, and Grossman (2005), describing extensions and
refinements developed while building an open source implementation of the grammar
of graphics for R, ggplot2.
The topics in this article include an introduction to the grammar by working through
the process of creating a plot, and discussing the components that we need. The gram-
mar is then presented formally and compared to Wilkinson’s grammar, highlighting the
hierarchy of defaults, and the implications of embedding a graphical grammar into a
programming language. The power of the grammar is illustrated with a selection of
examples that explore different components and their interactions, in more detail. The
article concludes by discussing some perceptual issues, and thinking about how we can
build on the grammar to learn how to create graphical “poems.”

  abstract     = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.
