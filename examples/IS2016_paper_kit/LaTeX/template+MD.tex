% Ilaria: I had to add the following commands: a pandoc command which was causing problems when using \tightlist (solution found here: https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates/blob/master/default.latex); this command is also found in the LaTex output created by RStudio.

\begin{document}

  \maketitle
  %
  \section{Header 1}\label{header-1}
  
  This is some very basic text.
  
  \subsection{Header 2}\label{header-2}
  
  This is some other text in a sub-heading. You can go on until level 6.
  
  Newlines are interpreted as new paragraphs.
  
  I can emphasize text like \emph{this} or like \textbf{this}.
  
  Unordered lists are created with symbols like *, -, +\ldots{} but the
  first item of the list needs to be preceded by an empty line:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    I like cooking
  \item
    I also like languages
  \item
    and I like folk music
  
    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      especially Blackbeard's Tea Party!
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  
  Ordered lists are created with numbers and dots. Even if you mess up the
  numbering, MD will fix it for you:
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Item 1
  \item
    Item 2
  \item
    Item 3
  \end{enumerate}
  
  Links can be added in text like this:
  \href{http://www.blackbeardsteaparty.com/}{click here} or like this:
  \url{http://www.blackbeardsteaparty.com/}
  
  Images are basically links, but they have to be also separated from the
  main text by an empty line before and after:
  
  \begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics{images/fluffycat.jpg}
  \caption{A super fluffy cat}
  \end{figure}
  
  
  Tables can be written with -- and \textbar{}\textbar{} symbols:
  
  \begin{longtable}[]{@{}lcr@{}}
  \toprule
  Tables & Are & Cool\tabularnewline
  \midrule
  \endhead
  col 3 is & right-aligned & \$1600\tabularnewline
  col 2 is & centered & \$12\tabularnewline
  zebra stripes & are neat & \$1\tabularnewline
  \bottomrule
  \end{longtable}
  
 
 \subsection{R Markdown}\label{r-markdown}
 
 This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
 for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
 using R Markdown see \url{http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com}.
 
 When you click the \textbf{Knit} button a document will be generated
 that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
 chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
  
%this is the output from pandoc, but we can eliminate these lines (I will just comment them out)
