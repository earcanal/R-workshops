# Introduction

These are additional files for the workshop on data workflow.

## Document setup

I need to load my functions

```{r}
source("functions.R")
```


## Data

The example data is in the `./data/` directory and already in a CSV file.

# Import

```{r}
raw_data <- import()
```

This creates a strange data set with just one column... It turns out, the file isn't really a CSV, but rather a TSV. I wrote another function that imports a TSV file:

```{r, message=FALSE}
raw_data <- please_import()
```
